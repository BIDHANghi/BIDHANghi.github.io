                    <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
                    <h5> Aug 14, 2020</h5>
                    <p>The Great Wall of China (Chinese: 萬里長城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng) is the collective name of a series of fortification
                        systems generally built across the historical northern borders of China to protect and consolidate territories of Chinese 
                        states and empires against various nomadic groups of the steppe and their polities. Several walls were being built from 
                        as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states;[2] selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi
                        Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[3] Later on, many successive dynasties
                        have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by
                        the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
